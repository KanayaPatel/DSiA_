# DSiA Project
Project done in Rori Rolfs' DSCI410L (Data Science in Action) Course @ University of Oregon, 2026

## Overview

After CAHOOTS was defunded in April 2025, the city of Eugene lost one of its organizations 
who would assist in a majority of welfare check calls. Most, if not all welfare check calls 
are now in the hands of the EPD. Given this, prior members of CAHOOTS asked us to take a 
look into the gaps the defunding caused. Specifically for this project:

- How have welfare checks been handled (by EPD? MCSLC?)?
- Has welfare check call volume changed?
- Has there been a change in the number of arrests during these welfare check calls?

## Setup and Installation

Ensure that Python 3.13 is installed on your device. Then, open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the DSiA directory. Run the following command to install all required packages: ```pip install -r "requirements.txt"```

## How to Run
Before running any files, ensure you have read and completed all steps in the [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation) section.

### 1. `clean_data.ipynb`
Cleans the raw data and produces three output files in the root directory:
- `cleaned_eug.csv` — Eugene CAD data including CAHOOTS calls
- `cleaned_spd.csv` — Springfield call data

### 2. `volume_analysis.ipynb`
Produces `diff_in_diff.png`, a difference-in-differences plot showing how the volume of welfare check calls changed after CAHOOTS was defunded. Springfield is used as a control, as they still have their version of CAHOOTS.

> Note: This file uses both of the cleaned files above. Run ```clean_data.ipynb``` first.

> Note: This file is incomplete.

### 3. `outcome_analysis.ipynb`
Produces a KDE distribution plot, `KDE_outcome.png`, showing how the number of arrests made during welfare checks changed after CAHOOTS was disbanded.

> Note: This file uses both cleaned files above. Run ```clean_data.ipynb``` first.
